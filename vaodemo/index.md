We provide a free evaluation version of our VAO Unity plugin (with watermark).

It contains all the features of a full version, except it does not run on Unity 5.6 (only Unity 2017.2 and higher).

If you like VAO and want to use it please buy it at [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/xzs) to support its development. Also let us know what you think, your feedback is welcome.

** NOTE: In the demo, the new raycast algorithm does not work correctly on some platforms. Please note that in full version it works without problems. This is due to some limitations given by the fact that demo is a pre-compiled .dll library. We are working on the fix to solve this issue.
