# Volumetric Ambient Occlusion 1.4.1 Demo

**[2017/5/2] UPDATED** *to version 1.4.1 (Single Pass Stereo Rendering support for VR)*

We provide a free evaluation version of our VAO Unity plugin (with watermark).

It contains all the features of a full version, except it does not run on Unity 5.3 (only Unity 5.4 and higher).

If you like VAO and want to use it please buy it at [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/xzs) to support its development. Also let us know what you think, your feedback is welcome.
