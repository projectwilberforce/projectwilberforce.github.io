We provide a free evaluation version of our VAO Unity plugin (with watermark).

It contains all the features of a full version, except it does not run on Unity 5.6 (only Unity 2017.2 and higher). Please note that the new temporal algorithms may render a few artifacts, which are only visible in the editor - not in the play mode. This does not apply to the full version.

If you like VAO and want to use it please buy it at [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/xzs) to support its development. Also let us know what you think, your feedback is welcome.
