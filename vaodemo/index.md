We provide a free evaluation version of our VAO Unity plugin (with watermark).

It contains all the features of a full version, except it does not run on Unity 5.6 (only Unity 2017.2 and higher).

If you like VAO and want to use it please buy it at [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/xzs) to support its development. Also let us know what you think, your feedback is welcome.

** This is a pre-release (Beta) version of v1.10 release. Final version will contain same set of features but we're optimizing code for faster build and fixing possible crash on OpenGL.
