# Final Lens Effects 1.2 Demo

We provide a free evaluation version of our Final Lens Unity plugin (with watermark).

It contains all the features of a full version, except it does not run on Unity 5.6 (only Unity 2017.1 and higher). 

If you like Final Lens Effects and want to use it please buy it at [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/Sgg) to support its development. Also let us know what you think, your feedback is welcome.
