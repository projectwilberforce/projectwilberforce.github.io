# Colorbleed 1.0 Demo

We provide a free evaluation version of our Colorbleed Unity plugin (with watermark).

It contains all the features of a full version, except it does not run on Unity 5.3 (only Unity 5.4 and higher).

If you like Colorbleed and want to use it please buy it at [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/85066) to support its development. Also let us know what you think, your feedback is welcome.
